About me
======


Research
--------

I am a Ph.D candidate at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology working with Dr. John Naliboff. My research centers on numerical modeling of subduction zones in both 2-Dimensions and 3-Dimensions with a focus on volatile cycling and how volatiles impact subduction dynamics. I use and have contributed to the open source modeling software ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion).
